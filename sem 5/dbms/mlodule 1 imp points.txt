RDBMS is the basic(frame work) of sql

database objects----- tables

table is the most common and simplest form of data storage in a RDBMS

field-- small entites/columns in a table.

constraints-- rules enforced on data coloumns on a table

-->they enable the accuracy and reliability of the data in the data base

--->constraints are applied to either columns level or table level

Eg: NOT NULL, DEFAULT, UNIQUE, Primary key, Forign Key

datamodels define the logical structure of a data base

--> how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

Relational Model

--> relations are stored in the form of tables
-->Relations(tables) can be normalized.

-->In normalized relations, values saved are atomic values.

-->Each row in a relation contains a unique value.

-->Each column in a relation contains values from a same domain
